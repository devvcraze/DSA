## Introduction

This repository is designed to help individuals improve their understanding of Data Structures and Algorithms through hands-on problem-solving. The problems are sourced from various platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, GeeksforGeeks, and others. The solutions are organized by topic, and each problem is documented with a detailed explanation of the approach and code.

## Motivation

DSA is a fundamental part of computer science and plays a crucial role in technical interviews. This repository serves as a personal guide to mastering DSA, as well as a resource for others who are preparing for interviews or looking to improve their problem-solving skills.

## Problem-Solving Approach

For each problem, I follow a structured approach:

1. **Understand the Problem Statement**: Read the problem carefully and identify the input, output, and constraints.
2. **Plan the Solution**: Think about different ways to solve the problem. Consider the time and space complexity of each approach.
3. **Implement the Solution**: Write the code in one or more programming languages. Ensure that it handles edge cases.
4. **Test the Solution**: Test the code with various test cases, including edge cases, to ensure its correctness.
5. **Optimize**: Analyze the solution and optimize it if possible. Compare different approaches and choose the most efficient one.

## Topics Covered

This repository covers a wide range of DSA topics, including but not limited to:
